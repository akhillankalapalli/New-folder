<h3>What is Python?</h3>
    <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
    
    Key Features
    Readability: Python’s syntax is clear and straightforward, making it easy to read and write code.
    Interpreted Language: Python is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.
    Dynamically Typed: You don’t need to declare the data type of a variable; Python infers it at runtime.
    Rich Standard Library: Python comes with a vast standard library that supports many common programming tasks.
    Cross-Platform: Python can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    Community Support: Python has a large and active community, which contributes to a wealth of resources, libraries, and frameworks.
    Getting Started
    Installation: You can download Python from the official website python.org. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
    Writing Code: You can write Python code in any text editor or use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebook.</p>
